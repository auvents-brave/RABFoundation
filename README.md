# rab-foundation // RabFoundation

A small pure and cross-platform Swift library (usable on Windows or WebAssembly for example). Without any specific context, it just includes reusable code, covering very different topics.

>  One day I created a folder on my HD to move various documents to organise or destroy at a later time. I called it ["rubrique à brac"](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/rubrique-à-brac), from the name of a French comic book series. Years later, when I was thinking about creating my first library to store code that could be used in different applications, the name RabLib just popped into my head!

I try to document the code as well as possible, and have a good coverage of unit tests, without being perfect either.
