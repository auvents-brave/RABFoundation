# Rubrique Ã  Brac // RABFoundation

RABFoundation is a plain Swift library for dealing with different points I generally use in my own softwares.

## Prerequisites

To be able to compile and run MiscStuff and the integration tests, you need to have a few prerequisites installed on your system.

However, this library may be able to be used by older environements, or under Linux systems.

### macOS

- Xcode 26 or newer. [Downloadable here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

### Windows

- Visual Studio Code. [Downloadable here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- Swift 6.2 or newer. [Downloadable here](https://swift.org/download/#releases). I always recommend to use the latest released version.
